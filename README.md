# Work in progress

## Goal

This is a demo project to recreate Amazon's selected pages' front end using Bel√©n del Olmo's [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/128266533/Amazon-Redesign?tracking_source=search_projects%7Camazon%20website). As of now, back-end implementation is not part of this project

The goal is to improve front end skills and create a showcase for my portfolio

## Stack

- React (using hooks)
- Typescript
- Redux (to be included)
- Sass (to be included)
- Jest (to be included)

API for fake shopping data: https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api

Note: Some elements in the stack such as Redux may seem like over engineering. The main reason is that this project is just a showcase to use different tools and improve my skills on such tools
